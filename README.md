# Financial Risk Analytics Dashboard

This project showcases a credit risk analytics pipeline integrating Power BI dashboards, R-based statistical modeling, and business intelligence insights for loan performance monitoring.This Power BI dashboard is designed to analyze a financial dataset simulating financial risk data. The main goal is to assess borrower creditworthiness, track loan performance, and identify default risks. It supports **risk-based lending**, **non-performing loan (NPL) minimization**, and **borrower segmentation**.
## Dataset Summary

- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset ‚Äì Financial Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jokimrodrigues/financial-risk-analysis-dataset)
- **Records:** 20,000+ loan applications  
- **Features:** 23 variables including:
  - `Credit_Score`, `Applicant_Income`, `Loan_Amount`, `Loan_Term_Months`, `Collateral_Value`, `Debt_to_Income_Ratio`, `Default_Status`, etc.

## Project Objectives

- Identify high-risk borrowers using credit and behavioral metrics  
- Segment borrowers by demographic and financial attributes  
- Support data-driven decision-making in credit approvals  
- Reduce NPLs through early risk detection

## Business Context

In Kenya‚Äôs evolving financial ecosystem‚Äîwhere mobile lending, SACCOs, DFIs, and fintech are thriving‚Äîaccurate borrower profiling is essential. This dashboard simulates a credit analysis tool for a microfinance or digital lender, offering real-time credit risk visibility to credit managers and analysts.
